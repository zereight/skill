# Jev Review

> **zereight fork:** vendored from [devagrawal09/jev-review](https://github.com/devagrawal09/jev-review) @ `31f8960` (MIT).
> The TypeSafe SDK is pointed at OpenRouter's System One API (`src/adapters/jev-system-one.ts`, default, model `jev-1.13`, key `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`). `JEV_PROVIDER=cursor` swaps in Cursor provider models (`cursor-system-one.ts`).
> `JEV_BASE=<ref>` reviews `<ref>...HEAD`. See `../SKILL.md`.

A small code-review workflow built with [TypeSafe Jev](https://typesafe.ai). It can review a Git diff or scan a complete codebase, follows the strongest structured signals through focused model calls, and presents the result in a quiet local dashboard.

## How It Works

The reviewer keeps orchestration in code and uses Jev for bounded judgments:

```text
Noul risk matrix
  -> Choice + Score file profiles
  -> Choice evidence selection
  -> Choice mechanism classification
  -> Score severity
  -> conditional Choice reviewer routing
```

- Exposes separate change-review and complete-codebase entry points.
- Uses changed or related tests as context when judging test gaps.
- Screens correctness, security, reliability, compatibility, and test coverage.
- Selects concrete diff hunks or source regions before scoring impact.
- Uses structured hints, counterexamples, and explicit decision boundaries.
- Applies thresholds and workflow policy in code.
- Shows large reports in collapsible dashboard sections.
- Binds the dashboard to `127.0.0.1` and never serves environment files.

## Quick Start

Requires Node.js 24+, Git, and a [TypeSafe API key](https://console.typesafe.ai/settings/keys).

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Add TYPESAFE_API_KEY to .env

# Review the current Git diff
npm run review:changes:save -- /path/to/git/repository

# Or scan every non-ignored source file under a scope
npm run review:codebase:save -- /path/to/git/repository-or-package
npm run dashboard
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:4317](http://127.0.0.1:4317).

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run review:changes -- <path>` | Print a current-diff review as JSON |
| `npm run review:changes:save -- <path>` | Save a current-diff review for the dashboard |
| `npm run review:codebase -- <path>` | Print a complete codebase scan as JSON |
| `npm run review:codebase:save -- <path>` | Save a complete codebase scan for the dashboard |
| `npm run dashboard` | Start the local dashboard |
| `npm run check` | Typecheck, verify dependency flow, and syntax-check the dashboard client |

## Architecture

Everything lives under `src/`, arranged in layers that only depend downward:

```text
src/
  domain/      config.ts, types.ts, patch.ts   shared policy, report shapes, diff parsing
  adapters/    git.ts, repository-files.ts     change and complete-source discovery
               report-store.ts                 atomic report save/load
  review/      changes.ts, codebase.ts          mode-specific workflows
               *-judgments.ts, workflow.ts     Jev calls and shared staged orchestration
  cli/         review-*.ts, save-*.ts           explicit mode entry points
  dashboard/   server.ts, public/              local-only HTTP server and the plain client
```

Imports point toward lower layers only:

```text
{ cli, dashboard } -> review -> adapters -> domain
```

`scripts/check-dependencies.ts` fails `npm run check` on any upward import, any
import between `cli` and `dashboard`, or any cycle.

## Current Scope

This is an experiment in composing fast typed judgments into a review workflow. It does not yet integrate compiler diagnostics, static analyzers, repository indexing, or generated explanations. Findings are review prompts, not proof of a defect.
